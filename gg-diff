Creating a detailed naming convention for DOCX documents in GitHub can help manage and track document changes effectively without creating duplicates. Here's a detailed naming convention proposal:

Naming Convention Structure
Prefix-DocumentType-Subject-OrTopic

Prefix: A short identifier for the project or team.
DocumentType: A standardized code for the type of document.
Subject: The main subject or topic of the document.
OrTopic: Additional descriptors to specify the document further if needed.
Examples
Prefix:

PRJ: Project-related documents.
TEAM: Team-specific documents.
CLIENT: Client-related documents.
DocumentType:

REQ: Requirements.
DES: Design.
MTG: Meeting notes.
RPT: Report.
MEMO: Memorandum.
Subject:

Main topic or focus of the document. Use concise and descriptive words.
OrTopic:

Additional information to distinguish similar documents.
Complete Examples
Project Requirements for a New Feature:

PRJ-REQ-NewFeature
Design Document for User Interface:

PRJ-DES-UI
Meeting Notes for Team Standup:

TEAM-MTG-Standup
Client Report for Monthly Review:

CLIENT-RPT-MonthlyReview
Versioning and Date Management Inside the Document
To ensure the date and version information are included inside the document and not in the name, follow these steps:

Header/Footer Inclusion: Add the version and date to the header or footer of the DOCX document.
Document Properties: Use the document properties feature in Word to include metadata like version, date, author, etc.
Workflow in GitHub
Initial Commit: Commit the document with its initial version without any version number in the filename.

Filename: PRJ-REQ-NewFeature.docx
Updating Document:

Open the document and update the content.
Update the version number and date inside the document (e.g., v1.1_20240809).
Commit Changes:

Save and commit the updated document with the same filename.
GitHub will track the changes in the document through the commit history.
Example Workflow
Initial document creation:

Filename: PRJ-REQ-NewFeature.docx
Inside document: Version: v1.0, Date: 2024-08-08
First update:

Update content and change inside document to: Version: v1.1, Date: 2024-08-09
Commit changes with a message: Update requirement for new feature to v1.1
Subsequent updates:

Continue updating the document content.
Increment the version number and update the date inside the document.
Commit each change with an appropriate commit message.
By following this naming convention and workflow, you can effectively manage DOCX documents in GitHub, track changes through commit history, and avoid creating duplicate files.













1. Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine. You can do this using the git clone command followed by the repository URL.


git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>


2. Check Out Each Commit Sequentially
You need to check out each commit sequentially to understand the changes made at each step. Use the following commands to list and check out commits:
List All Commits


git log --oneline

This will display a list of commits with their short SHA (commit ID) and commit message.

Check Out a Specific Commit

git checkout <commit-id>

Replace <commit-id> with the actual commit ID you want to check out.

3. Review Changes Made in Each Commit
For each commit, review the changes made. You can do this using the git show command:


git show <commit-id>
This will show the changes introduced in the specified commit.

4. Document or Implement Changes Locally
While reviewing each commit, document the changes or implement them step by step in your own local environment. This helps in understanding the incremental development process.

5. Move to the Next Commit
After reviewing and documenting the changes in one commit, move to the next commit. You can do this by checking out the next commit ID:


git checkout <next-commit-id>
Alternatively, you can use:


git checkout HEAD~1
This command checks out the previous commit relative to the current one.

6. Repeat Until All Commits Are Reviewed
Repeat the process until you have reviewed and documented all the commits from the start to the latest.

7. Switch Back to the Latest Commit
Once you have reviewed all commits, you can switch back to the latest commit using:


git checkout main
or


git checkout master
depending on the default branch name.

Additional Tips
Create a Separate Branch: If you want to make changes or experiments, create a new branch from each commit to keep your work organized.


git checkout -b <new-branch-name>
Use git diff: To see differences between commits, use the git diff command:


git diff <commit-id1> <commit-id2>
Commit Messages: Pay close attention to commit messages as they often contain useful context about the changes.

Example Workflow
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo

# List all commits
git log --oneline

# Check out the first commit
git checkout abc1234

# Review the changes in the first commit
git show abc1234

# Document or implement changes locally

# Move to the next commit
git checkout def5678

# Repeat the process
git show def5678
Following these steps will help you re-create the project from scratch by understanding and applying each change made in the commits.







To list the files added in each commit using git show, you can use the --name-status option. This will display the status of each file (e.g., added, modified, deleted) in the commit.

Here is how you can do it:


git show --name-status <commit-id>
Example

# Show details of a specific commit with files added/modified/deleted
git show --name-status abc1234
This will provide you with output like this:


commit abc1234
Author: Your Name <you@example.com>
Date:   Mon Aug 10 10:00:00 2024 +0000

    Commit message

A       file1.txt
M       file2.txt
D       file3.txt
In this example:

A indicates a file was added.
M indicates a file was modified.
D indicates a file was deleted.
Iterating Through Commits to List Added Files
If you want to list only the files added across all commits, you can use a loop in the terminal:


git log --pretty=format:"%h" | while read commit; do
  echo "Commit: $commit"
  git show --name-status $commit | grep ^A
done
This will iterate through each commit and list only the files that were added.

Complete Workflow with Listing Added Files
Hereâ€™s the complete workflow for cloning the repository, listing the files added in each commit, and checking out each commit sequentially:


# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/user/repo.git
cd repo

# List all commits
commits=$(git log --pretty=format:"%h")

# Iterate through each commit to list files added
for commit in $commits; do
  echo "Commit: $commit"
  git show --name-status $commit | grep ^A
done
This script will output the commit ID followed by the list of files added in each commit.

Using git diff for a More Granular View
If you want a more granular view of the changes between commits, including added, modified, and deleted files, you can use git diff:


git diff --name-status <commit-id1> <commit-id2>
This will show you the differences between two commits, including which files were added, modified, or deleted.

Example Usage of git diff

# Compare two commits
git diff --name-status abc1234 def5678
This will output:

css
Copy code
A       newfile.txt
M       modifiedfile.txt
D       deletedfile.txt
By following these steps, you will be able to see the files added in each commit, understand the changes made, and recreate the steps from scratch.
