import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {

};

export default nextConfig;


Copy the entire `.next/standalone` directory to a new location (e.g., `C:\Users\YourUsername\Desktop\standalone-test`)
Copy your `public` directory (if it exists) into this new `standalone-test` directory
Copy the `.next/static` directory into `standalone-test/.next/static`

I understand that you're working with a server that's not connected to the internet and you can't install iisnode or use npm to install pm2. In this case, we'll need to use a different approach to run your Next.js application on Windows without these tools. Here's a method using a simple batch script and the built-in Windows Task Scheduler:

1. Create a batch script to start your Node.js application:
Create a new file named `start-nextjs.bat` in your application's root directory (where `server.js` is located) with the following content:

@echo off
cd /d %~dp0
node server.js

This script changes to the directory where it's located and then starts your Node.js application.


Configure IIS as a reverse proxy:

Since we can't use iisnode, we'll set up IIS to act as a reverse proxy to your Node.js application.

a. Install Application Request Routing (ARR) for IIS:
You'll need to download this manually and transfer it to your server if it's not already installed. You can find it on the Microsoft website.

b. Configure URL Rewrite in IIS:

- Open IIS Manager
- Select your website
- Double-click on "URL Rewrite"
- Add a new rule with these settings:

- Name: "Reverse Proxy to Node.js"
- Pattern: `(.*)`
- Action Type: "Rewrite"
- Rewrite URL: `http://localhost:3000/{R:1}`





c. Create a `web.config` file in your application's root directory:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<configuration>
    <system.webServer>
        <rewrite>
            <rules>
                <rule name="Reverse Proxy to Node.js" stopProcessing="true">
                    <match url="(.*)" />
                    <conditions>
                        <add input="{REQUEST_FILENAME}" matchType="IsFile" negate="true" />
                    </conditions>
                    <action type="Rewrite" url="http://localhost:3000/{R:1}" />
                </rule>
            </rules>
        </rewrite>
    </system.webServer>
</configuration>


3. Use Windows Task Scheduler to keep your application running:

a. Open Task Scheduler (search for it in the Start menu)

b. Create a new task with these settings:

1. Name: "Start Next.js Application"
2. Run whether user is logged on or not
3. Do not store password
4. Run with highest privileges


c. Triggers:

1. At system startup


d. Actions:

1. Start a program
2. Program/script: `C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe`
3. Add arguments: `/c "C:\path\to\your\start-nextjs.bat"`
4. Start in: `C:\path\to\your\application\directory`


e. Settings:

1. Allow task to be run on demand
2. Restart every: 1 minute
3. Attempt to restart up to: 3 times



4. Start your application:

1. Right-click on the task you just created in Task Scheduler and select "Run"
2. This will start your Node.js application



5. Configure a custom URL (if needed):

a. Edit the hosts file:

1. Open Notepad as Administrator
2. Open the file: `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts`
3. Add a new line like this: `127.0.0.1 mycustomurl.local`
4. Save the file


b. Update IIS bindings:

1. In IIS Manager, select your website
2. Click "Bindings" in the right panel
3. Add a new binding for `mycustomurl.local`



Remember to replace `C:\path\to\your\application\directory` with the actual path to your Next.js application directory.

This setup will:

1. Use a batch script to start your Node.js application
2. Use Windows Task Scheduler to keep your application running and restart it if it crashes
3. Use IIS as a reverse proxy to forward requests to your Node.js application
4. Allow you to access your application via a custom URL


Note that this method doesn't provide the same level of integration and management that iisnode would, but it should work for running your Next.js application on a Windows server without internet access.

If you need to stop or restart your application, you can do so through the Task Scheduler.
